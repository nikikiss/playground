### [London district dashboard](./Excel/London_district_dashboard.xlsx)
An interactive dashboard which was built on the population projection dataset, downloaded from London datastore. The goal of the dash is to give a quick overview about the population for the chosen district (within London), for the chosen time period. The dash automatically refresh if the following parameters are changed from the drop down:
- district
- from year
- to year

The dash includes five sections:
- Absolute number of population for the two chosen years and average annual change (%)
- Distribution of the population, based on age groups for the chosen years
- Projection of population of the district from 2011 to 2050
- Gender distribution changes for the two chosen years
- Top districts based on the number of population for the analysis start and end year (including the district, even if it is out of top 10)
